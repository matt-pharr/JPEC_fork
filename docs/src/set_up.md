## On Windows via WSL (Ubuntu)
1. Install WSL and Ubuntu
   If you don't already have WSL and Ubuntu installed, set this up. [This page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) gives detailed instructions on how to complete the installation. In the Windows Powershell,

   1. Make sure WSL is installed:
        ```PowerShell
        wsl --install
        ```
    2. Set Ubuntu as your default WSL distro:
        ```PowerShell
        wsl --set-default Ubuntu
        ```
    3. Launch Ubuntu and update:
        ```PowerShell
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```
2. Install build tools in WSL
    ```shell
    sudo apt install build-essential gfortran cmake -y
    ```

    `build-essential` → GCC, make

    `gfortran` → Fortran compiler

    `cmake` → sometimes needed by dependencies

3. Install Julia in WSL

    1. Download the latest Linux tarball from the official site [Julia downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/). It will look like
        ```shell
        wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.11/julia-1.11.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
        ```

        ☆ Replace the URL with the latest stable version.

    2. Extract and move it to /opt (or any path):

        ```shell
        tar -xvzf julia-1.11.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
        sudo mv julia-1.11.3 /opt/
        ```

        ☆ Ensure these commands match the tarball you installed. These commands match the above tarball and might need to be modified for you installation.

    3. Add Julia to PATH:

        ```shell
        echo 'export PATH=/opt/julia-1.11.3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

    4. Test it is properly installed

        ```shell
        julia --version
        ```

4. Install Python/Jupyter in WSL

   This step is only really required if you want to run the `.ipynb` test notebooks. You do not necessarily need Python3 installed, but Jupyter runs on a Python server.
   If you do not want to install Python3 and Jupyter, you can install the "IJulia" package to your Julia environment instead and run the command 'notebook()' in the terminal.
   1. To install Python3 and Jupyter notebooks, use these commands
        ```shell
        sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y
        python3 -m pip install --user jupyter jupyterlab notebook ipykernel
        ```
    ⚠ Important: Add local Python scripts to PATH:

        ```shell
        echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```
    2. Verify it is properly installed

        ```shell
        jupyter --version
        ```

5. Clone JPEC into your WSL home folder.
Clone it from GitHub directly to your virtual machine.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/OpenFUSIONToolkit/JPEC.git
    cd JPEC
    ```

6. Build Fortran dependencies (libspline.so)
    1. Go to the spline source folder:
        ```shell
        cd ~/JPEC/src/Splines/fortran
        ```

    2. Clean previous builds using
        ```shell
        make clean
        ```

    3. Build
        ```shell
        make
        ```

    4. Verify the library exists using
        ```shell
        ls ../../../deps/libspline.so
        ```

    5. Export library path so Julia can find it
        ```shell
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/JPEC/deps:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ```

        Optional: add to `~/.bashrc` for persistence.

7. Install the Julia packages for JPEC
    1. Launch Julia:
        ```shell
        julia
        ```
    2. In Julia REPL:
        ``` julia
        using Pkg
        Pkg.instantiate()       # install recorded dependencies
        Pkg.add("Preferences")  # install missing dependency if needed
        Pkg.build("IJulia")     # rebuild kernel
        Pkg.precompile()        # precompile all packages - probably unnecessary
        ```

8. At this point, you should be able to run the code, open a `.ipynb` notebook, or connect VS Code to your WSL session.
    1. To open a .ipynb notebook
        1. Launch Jupyter from WSL, make sure you have exited Julia using the `exit()` command and then type in the shell
        ```shell
        jupyter notebook --no-browser
        ```
        It will print a URL with a token.

        2. Copy the URL into your Windows browser **OR** open the notebook in VS Code using the **Remote - WSL** extension.

    2. (Optionally) Integrate WSL with VS Code
        1. Install **Remote - WSL** extension in VS Code.
        2. Open VS Code → Connect To → Connect to WSL.
        3. Click Open Folder and then navigate to the JPEC folder on your VM. Open your JPEC folder from WSL: ~/JPEC.

        If this is not working, you can launch vscode from the WSL shell you have using the command `code .`

        4. Open a terminal inside VS Code — it will automatically use WSL/Ubuntu.
        5. You can now run:
            ```shell
            make        # rebuild libspline.so if needed
            julia       # run scripts
            jupyter notebook --no-browser
            ```

        6. VS Code also lets you open `.ipynb` notebooks in the WSL environment using the Jupyter extension. Click the "Select Kernel" button in the top right hand of the `.ipynb` file and select the Julia kernel installed in WSL.All dependencies (libspline.so, Julia packages) are accessible.
3.  Run JPEC
        1. Make sure you are in WSL terminal, with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set to include deps.
        2. Launch Julia and run your scripts as usual:
            ```shell
            include("path/to/jpec_script.jl")
            ```

## RDCON Fortran reference fixtures

RDCON reference fixtures rely on the Fortran executable in `src/DCON/rdcon_fortran/rdcon`.
You will need a Fortran compiler and netCDF libraries available when rebuilding the executable.

1. Build the RDCON Fortran executable:
    ```shell
    julia --project=. -e 'using JPEC.DCON; DCON.build_rdcon_fortran!()'
    ```
2. Run a reference case and regenerate its fixture:
    ```shell
    julia --project=. -e 'using JPEC.DCON; DCON.run_rdcon_reference("rdcon_case_01")'
    ```
3. Repeat for additional cases (e.g., `rdcon_case_02`) as needed.

To skip rebuilding when the executable already exists, set `JPEC_RDCON_SKIP_BUILD=1`.

## Pre-commit Hooks (Optional Developer Tools)

The repository uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and prevent noisy commits from Jupyter notebook metadata and outputs.

### Why Use Pre-commit Hooks?

Pre-commit hooks automatically:
- Strip Jupyter notebook outputs, execution counts, and metadata (prevents merge conflicts and noisy diffs)
- Format Julia code according to `.JuliaFormatter.toml` settings
- Remove trailing whitespace and fix line endings
- Validate YAML/TOML syntax
- Prevent accidentally committing large files (>5MB)

### Installation

```bash
# Install pre-commit (requires Python/pip)
pip install pre-commit

# Install JuliaFormatter globally (required for Julia code formatting hook)
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("JuliaFormatter")'

# Install the git hooks in your local repository
cd /path/to/JPEC
pre-commit install
```

### Usage

Once installed, the hooks run automatically on `git commit`. You can also run them manually:

```bash
# Run on all files in the repository
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run only on currently staged files
pre-commit run
```

### Bypassing Hooks (Not Recommended)

In rare cases where you need to bypass the hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

However, this is discouraged as it may introduce notebook clutter or formatting inconsistencies.

### Optional: Standalone nbstripout Filter

For additional protection beyond pre-commit, you can install nbstripout as a git filter:

```bash
# Install nbstripout globally
pip install nbstripout

# Install filter for this repository
cd /path/to/JPEC
nbstripout --install
```

This ensures notebooks are cleaned even if pre-commit is bypassed with `--no-verify`. However, this is **optional** and not required for normal development - the pre-commit hook is sufficient for most workflows.
